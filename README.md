Unity C# Quest system


Oh, hi man!
I'm not sure that this code fully work. But I have some realised inventory and trade sysmes somewere in my local Unity projects. As I can saw, you creating some pixel farm. If you can explain me, what kind of inventory you need, I try code something in free time. I have some expiriense in gamedev, but only one small simple project wich I can called "finished". But it all dropped in different stage, so I have a lot of pieces of game functions. And some skills, of corse... 
So... if you need some help or something, feel free to ask me: harisyork@outlook.com

This is my first git-fork. so I'm very exited!) And I don't quite know how github's social functions work, so my message looks like this)
P.S. Sorry for my bad english, it's not my first language, but i try to learn and dont use translator.
